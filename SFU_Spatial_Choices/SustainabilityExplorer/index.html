				<h2 class="text-color">Welcome to the Sustainability Explorer!</h2>
				<p>Mission Statement: In 2012, the City of Vancouver released the <a href="http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Greenest-city-action-plan.pdf">Greenest City 2020 Action Plan</a>. The action plan consists of 10 different goals. Each goal is designed to address one aspect to achieve sustainability. The Sustainability Explorer is designed to promote the goals outlined in the action plan and to help achieve these goals.</p>
				
				<p>The Sustainability Explorer is unique in that it contains a trio of three apps within one. Each of these mini-apps are catered to help achieve the goals outlined in the Greenest City 2020 Action Plan. The first tab, titled Parks and Trails, aims to achieve Goal 6, Access to Nature. The mini-app displays all the parks and park trails within Vancouver. There is also an elevation profile tool that you can use to gauge the amount of effort needed for each park or park trail. The second tab, titled Sustainability Projects Locator, tries to achieve almost all of the goals in the action plan. This mini-app displays all the sustainability-related projects currently being administered by the city and private enterprises. It also runs off volunteered geographic data, if a private citizen wants to embark on their own personal sustainability project, they can place the location of their project and even advertise it with links and pictures. There are also a few analysis tools where an end user can create buffers, calculate the density of projects, or create drive-time areas. These tools can help figure out which areas are in need of sustainability projects or help you decide which project to participate in. The third tab, titled Green Businesses, aims to achieve Goal 1, Green Economy. This mini-app runs solely off volunteered geographic data. Entrepreneurs who are starting sustainability-related or green companies can put the location and information about their businesses in this app. There are also similar analysis tools as the the ones seen in the second tab. These tools can help new entrepreneurs decide where to start their company or decide what kind of company to start up.</p>
