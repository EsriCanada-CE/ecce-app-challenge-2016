Submission to Esri for the 2016 App Challenge
Mission Statement: Provide Hamiltonians the locations and important information about
local food producers to increase sustainable farming and promote small businesses.
Our group has created an app that provides consumers with locations of restaurants,
grocery stores, bakeries and coffee shops that sell locally sourced, vegan or overall sustainable
food.
Using locally sourced ingredients is important because:
1. Fewer Carbon Emissions: since the ingredients have less of a distance to travel, less
nonrenewable
resources are used in their transportation
2. Supporting Local Economies: this creates a greater sense of wellbeing
for local
businesses. It provides support for local farmers and retailers.
3. Preservation of Agricultural Land: if local farms cannot support themselves then they will
be forced to sell their land. This land is usually bought and developed, contributing to
urban sprawl, which takes a very high toll on the environment.
4. Better Nutrition: by eating seasonal we can provide ourselves with fresh and healthy
ingredients which will increase the overall health and wellbeing of the community. It also
supports genetic diversity of the plants, rather than having mass produced GMO
vegetables, the natural genetic diversity of the plants can be maintained.
5. Better for Wildlife: by preserving and supporting small, local family farms there is less of
a toll on the environment. This supports animal habitats and also sustains locally
available meats, such as deer. Smaller farms that are organic and freerange
also
provide better care and quality of life for their livestock.
Eating locally grown and produced foods creates a sustainable city. It also reduces
emissions from processing and travelling helping towards the reduction of climate change. It is
important to note that local and sustainable are not interchangeable. When we use the term
local, we are indicating that the food is provided directly from local farms. For the reasons
mentioned above it is clear that eating food which is produced locally is a much more
sustainable option.
How It Works:
This is a webapp and is therefore available through the attached link. All you need is wifi
and the app should configure to the screen size that you are using. All features are outlined in
the tutorial video.
