## Synopsis

The Sustainability Evaluator Application is a web based service which breaks down the neighborhoods in the downtown Victoria (British Columbia) area, and displays relevant data.
These data can then be evaluated by the user in order to make a decision about the sustainability and the environmental aspects of the community.

## Motivation

The inspiration behind this project arose from the lack of availability of simple tools which are developped for both families and individuals to plan for the future.
Using the Sustainability Evaluator decisions can be made about the forecoming conditions of the selected community.

## Installation

This is deployed using the Web-App Builder hosted on the ESRI servers.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
