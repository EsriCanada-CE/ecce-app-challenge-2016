# Mission statement

>“Where is Water” aims at helping people find tap water sources in Waterloo Region. In most cases, people would prefer bottle water rather than fountain just because they do not know the nearest fountain. Under this circumstance, many plastic bottles are produced. With the help of our web app, people can use potable water to meet their needs; therefore, we can reduce the amount of used bottle, which will relieve environmental stress.
