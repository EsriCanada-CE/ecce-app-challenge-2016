# Characteristic Statement

>This web app has three main functions: find the service area of a specific tap water, find the directions to users’ desired water source, locate future tap water. For the first function, we use network analysis to calculate service area. User can first specify the exact water source and then choose 200, 500, or 1000 meters as the desired distance. For the second function, users can choose points by clicking on map to find the direction between their location and desired water source. For the third function, we use spatial join to find tap-water-clustered area for future investment’s reference.
