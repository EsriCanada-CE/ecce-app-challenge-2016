Our project’s goal is addressing the sustainability of the City of Surrey, and finding the ways of improvement.
When people open the Sustainability of the City of Surrey web app, they will see five widgets: layer list, attribute table, information summary, and analysis, incident analysis.
The layer list allows people to check all layers in this web app.
Land use layers show the multiple land usages in the City of Surrey.  Compact forms for residential and mixed land use will improve the city sustainability because close proximity of land will save time on traveling.
Public transportation layer and bike route layer show the environmental friendly transportation.  Buffer of bus stops layer can show the accessibility for public transportations.  As overlay these environmental friendly transportation layers with residential layers, people can see which residential places can easily access these transportation services and which residential places have difficulty to access.  Once selecting more layers about industry, institution, and commercial, which contain the most of jobs, people can see if the green transportations can provide the connections between works and home.
Open nature space, green infrastructure corridors, and nature trails layers shows the natural protection spaces which are the important to maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity.  The green infrastructure corridors connect the majority open nature spaces which allows animals’ migration, and species following.
Water utility services layer and garbage recycling layer are green facility services, which make the energies be reusable.
Attribute table provides the detailed properties for each layer.  People can get more information of layers through it to do the deep researches.
Information summary counts the quantities for point layers (bus stop, garbage and recycling, and water facility service).  It straightly shows the number of variables to let people check if it is enough for the area.
Analysis gives people a chance to do more geoprocessing analysis for each layer on the study area.  Density calculation allows people to work on lines’ and points’ features.  For example, people can see if there are a lot of public transportations and bus stops around their home.  Buffer creation can show the surrounding area for a specific feature; it may include the service areas, or effected area.  For example, creating a buffer for agriculture area can let people know if there are industries or high polluted facilities around it.  Derive a new location allows people find a specific location by its attributes.  For example, if people want to find pump stations, they can select water facility by type of pump station.
Incident analysis is similar with analysis, but it can work on a people selected small area instead of the entire study area.
