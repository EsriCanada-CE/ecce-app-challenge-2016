ESRI App Challenge 2016

Group Members: Nicole Bird & Kyle Wittenberg

Mission Statement: The HRM Sea Level Rise app allows users to visualize the effects that sea level rise could have on their homes and communities along the Halifax harbour. With climate change as a popular growing concern, this app will be important to bring local awareness to the impacts of sea level change.

Characteristics: The app allows users to select an address or a location of interest and one of three sea level rise heights to demonstrate what area will be covered by water in each case. The slider tool creates a visual comparison between the available levels.  The three selectable layers include a 1 meter, 10 meter and 65 meter option, ranging from possible to worst –case scenarios.
