### Summary of App

This interactive app is designed to help you to explore sustainable
cities in Canada and discover which city fits your sustainability needs
based on seven different sustainability indices.

Sustainability focuses on balancing the fine line between a number of
competing needs found in today's society. This includes our need to move
forward technologically and economically, the needs to protect the
environment in which we and others live and the need to grow and develop
socially. Works across all platforms.

The seven indices used in the sustainability ranking system are:

1.  Desired Population
2.  Labor Force Stability
3.  Household Census Data
4.  Waste & Water Management
5.  Community Safety & Education
6.  Green Mobility

### Limitations and Known Issues

A limitation of the app is due to the Visualization API rendering for
Google sheets. The minimum refresh interval once Google sheets is
published to a website up to five minutes. Therefore, users need to wait
a maximum of five minutes to receive their results after taking the
quiz. This time period gives users the chance to interact with the other
features of the app.

### Long-term vision and applications:

The focus of this application to increase the user’s awareness about
sustainability and sustainable initiatives in the major urban centres of
Canada. Sustainability is crucial to the balance and well-being of a
city’s operations and development. This app allows users to pinpoint
what areas of sustainability are important to them and which cities in
Canada possess such qualities. The heat map overtime will also lead to
an indication of what users are looking for in a city and what features
are most important to them.
