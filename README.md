ECCE App Challenge 2016
==================

## Instructions:
These are the instructions for submitting your work during the ECCE App Challenge. First, you should create a README.md Markdown file for your app ([this link will show you how to create a Markdown file](http://markdownlivepreview.com)).  The README file should state the goals of your app, and how to use it and deploy it.  For example, check out the [README file from last year's App Challenge winners](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2015/tree/master/UW_TeamSDS).

In addition to the README file, the following items should be included in your App Challenge submission:

1. Mission statement for your app (i.e., what the apps seeks to achieve and why);
1. Statement of the characteristics of the app that make it appealing, interesting and useful  (i.e. how does it help the end user);
1. A video with voice over that demonstrates use of your app (can be a link to a YouTube video or a separate file); and
1. An organized code base suitable for upload to a GitHub code repository.

Feel free to check out [submissions from last year's App Challenge](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2015), or refer to the App Challenge brief sent out at the start of the competition for further clarification on what include in your submission.  At the end of the App Challenge (which is specified in the App Challenge brief), email [Cam Plouffe](mailto:cplouffe@esri.ca) a ZIP file containing your app and all the required deliverables before the stated deadline.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
