#Mission Statement
###  problem
In community and city development, static or dynamic maps do not show the 
relative distribution of community development resources. A relative 
visual comparison highlights rich neighbourhood’s vs poor, but this is 
lacking in current map products. 

### solution
Community Green Spaces (CGS) is an app designed to allow community and city planners or individuals the ability to visualize the spatial distribution of green spaces (environmental, social and economic) at the community level. This can serve as a tool for stakeholder engagement during the planning stage of new community projects.
