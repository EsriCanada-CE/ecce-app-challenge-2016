ABOUT GUARDEN

Guarden is a web-based application that allows users to analyze the spatial distribution of local community gardens in the city of Vancouver, BC. The application is designed to be used on tablets and desktops. However, basic location of gardens can also be utilized on a smartphone.

This app is designed to serve the user in 2 ways. The first is by familiarizing the user to community gardens in their neighbourhood. The second is providing the tools to engage in the analytical potential of these large Vancouver Open Source Data sets through data visualization.
