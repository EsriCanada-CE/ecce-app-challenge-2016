###Getting Started

Download the Marauders-mAPP as a .zip file. Extract to the location of your choice. Then open the folder and navigate to the "Try Me!" Folder. Click the "GetStarted" file to initiate the app.

###App Usage
From the main page, the user may click the start button to continue to the interactive neighbourhoods map. A helpful infographic instructs the user of the functionality of this page, prompting them to select a neighbourhood they are interested to explore the potential to grow vegetables. The infographic also directs the user towards a demo video where they may watch a video of the app in action. 
Upon selecting a neighbourhood, the user is taken to a residential scale map where individual buildings can be seen. The user may then choose to being drawing their garden by selecting the draw icon in the top left.If the user decides to switch to an imagery bassemap, or return to the previous page, icon buttons exists to carry out these tasks. Following the instructions in the popup infographic, the user can begin to construct their garden and view the "Potential2Grow" data for the garden they have drawn. This includes the area of the garden as well as the expected yields for each vegetable. Additionally, the user is directed towards the water requirements field to view how much water is required to supplement their garden. If the user wishes to view the potential for rainwater collection, they need only click on nearby buildings to see the total catchment calculated over a growing season. The option exists for drawing of multiple gardens to compare the "Potential2Grow" statistics.


###Limitations & Known Issues
* The App is limited by the available imagery as provided in the Esri Imagery Basemap, where low resolution exists, the streets basemap acts as an alternative.
* When in Google Chrome or Opera Browsers, the double click to finish drawing feature is disfunctional. The finish measurement button must be used
* A selection of 10 common garden vegetables were selected and yield by area calculations, as well as water requirements are shown for only those secific vegetables. May not be representative of vegetables not included in the popup

###Assumptions
* All values are estimations made on current climate data. Rainwater collection values are based on interpolated rain data from local rain gauges ove the previous 6 year period.
* Building rooflines are only approximate representations of actual roofline and some innacuracy is inherently present
* Vegetable yields are calculated on an area and water requirement basis and optimal nutrient/fertilization fulfillments are assumed.
* Growing seasons are assumed to be May 1st - September 30th.

###Data Sources
Several Publically Available Datasets were utilized in the App's Construction

*Spatial Datasets: Used on License from the City of Edmonton Open Data Portal*
* Neighbourhoods - Shapefile for all 383 neighbourhoods in Edmonton
* Rooflines - Shapefile for all 327000 building rooflines in Edmonton
* Weather Gauge Data(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015) - 15 gauges spread across the city.
